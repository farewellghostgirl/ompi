OpenMPI+Opal v4.1.7 header bindings for D (to be submited to Deimos)

## Description
Currently, I'm trying to interface OpenMPI header and types with D for my own purposes. This is extremely barebones (and unfunctional) for the moment.
I also need to write an alternative to their autoconf scripts, and bind Opal as well.

## Status

C library: OpenMPI v4.1.7 ``mpi.h.in`` up to commit 50c05da
